In this application, you will check the brightness of the LED again according to the value received from the analog pin. In the first LED lighting application, it was possible to send 0V or 5V to the LED as we used a digital output.
So, the LED was either off or on. Using a new feature of Arduino, you will be able to send voltage to the LED at intermediate values in the range of 0-5V. Voltage control enables to adjust the brightness of the LED.
Until this application, you have learned about digital input-output and analog input. With this application, you will learm the analog output, i.e. the PWM feature. 

Now, let's set up the circuit and continue with coding.
