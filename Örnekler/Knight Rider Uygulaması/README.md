## Knight Rider Application With Arduino Details
In this application you will see the use of the "for" loop. The "for" loop can be used for successive operations. In order to turn on 6 LEDs in the application, you will need to set output for them all and turn on respectively. This can be easily implemented with the output identification and LED lighting commands that you have learned before. If you want to make changes to the written code without using the "for" loop, you will have to make changes to each line one by one, however, in the "for" loop you can proceed musch faster both in understanding and writing the code.

After setting up the circuit, let's continue with coding.
