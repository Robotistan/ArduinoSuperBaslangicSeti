## RGB LED Application

In this application, we want to light up intermediate colors besides full brightness. we need to use PWM to turn th LED on to the desired brightness level. Since PWM feature is present in certain legs (3,5,6,9,10,11), we will pay attention to use these legs when making connections.

Let's set up the circuit and then start writing our project code.
