## Servo Motor Ccontrol with Motion Sensor


In this example, you will use a motion detector to set up a system where you can move the motor when motion is detected in the environment
The motion sensor works by detecting infrared light waves in the environment. Materials naturally emit infrared waves because of heat. The motion sensor detects the changes in the infrared waves emitted by the materials and produces the signal output.
in this sample code, you will read the data from the motion detector and ensure the movement of the servo motor when a motion is detected in the environment.


Let's set up the circuit and then start writing our project code.
