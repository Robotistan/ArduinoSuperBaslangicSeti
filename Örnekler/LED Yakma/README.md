## LED Lighting Details
- What is the LED? 

The LED is the abbreviation of light emitting diode. It is usually made of gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide semiconductor materials. The LED has two electrodes: a positive electrode and a negative one. It lights up only when a forward current passes, and it can flash red, blue, green, yellow, etc. The colour of the light depends on the material it is made. In general, the drive current for LED is 5-20mA. Therefore, in reality it usually needs an extra resistor for current limitation so as to protect the LED.

- What is resistor? 

The main function of the resistor is to limit currents. In the circuit, the character ‘R’ represents resistor, and the unit of resistor is ohm(Ω). A band resistor is used in this experiment. It is a resistor with a surface coated with some particular colour through which the resistance can be identified directly.


Let's set up the circuit and then start writing our project code.
