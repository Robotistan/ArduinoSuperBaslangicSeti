## Making Park Sensors With Ultrasonic Sensor

You will meet a new application model in this ultrasonic sensor application. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor has metal parts that can send and detect sounds. After the sound is sent from the sensor, if it is reflected from any object or obstacle available and comes back to the sensor. The receiver can detect the reflected signal and make a measurement.

The duration between the time when the sensor is sent and received is measured in order to calculate the distance. Since we know the speed of sound in the air, we can calculate the total distance by time and speed. 

After setting up the circuit, let's continue with coding.
