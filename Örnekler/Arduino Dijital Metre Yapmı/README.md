## Making a Digital Meter with Arduino

The ultrasonic distance sensor is a device that can send a sound wave and detect the reflected sound wave. LCD is an element that displays characters on the screen according to the data provided. The LCD screen consists of 2 lines and can display 16 characters per line. Each character consists of 5x7 pixels.
The potentiometer is an adjustable resistor. in this circuit we used the potentiometer as a voltage divider. When the voltage is sent to two different resistors connected in series, voltages proportional to the resistance values on the resistors are obtained. And the potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider. When the potentiometer is turned, the voltage of the middle pin changes. This changing voltage allows adjusting the Contrast of the LCD screen. Let's continue with setting up the circuit.



After setting up the circuit, let's continue with coding.
